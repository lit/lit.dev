The methods used in the previous steps are great when working with a single
iterable as a source of data but sometimes the situation might call for a more
imperative approach.

In this example, the component has properties `members` that's an array
of strings, `pets` that's an array of objects, and `includePets` which holds a
boolean controlled with a button.

Render a list item for each member but also include pets if `includePets` is
`true`. The list item for the pet should include both the name and the species.

Populate the `listItems` array conditionally based on the boolean state
like shown below.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    const listItems = [];
    for (const friend of this.friends) {
      listItems.push(html`<li>${friend}</li>`);
    }
    if (this.includePets) {
      for (const pet of this.pets) {
        listItems.push(html`<li>${pet.name} (${pet.species})</li>`);
      }
    }
    ⋮
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    const listItems = [];
    for (const friend of this.friends) {
      listItems.push(html`<li>${friend}</li>`);
    }
    if (this.includePets) {
      for (const pet of this.pets) {
        listItems.push(html`<li>${pet.name} (${pet.species})</li>`);
      }
    }
    ⋮
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Then add the `listItems` array to your element's template.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    ⋮
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${listItems}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    ⋮
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${listItems}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Click the button to see if the conditional rendering is working properly.

Extra Credit: Try refactoring the code to abstract out the logic from the
`render()` method into its own private method that returns the array of
templates and invoke it within the template expression where `listItems`
currently is.

There are several ways of adding event listeners to list items getting rendered,
but care must be taken to ensure the correct information is made available to
the event handler. This step shows one way of achieving this.

The example currently has an array of strings in the `things` property that are
being rendered as list items with a "Delete" button which does not do anything
yet.

First, create a method that will be called when the button is clicked that will
remove the item from the `things` array. It will take the item's index.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ⋮
  private _deleteThing(index: number) {
    this.things = this.things.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
  }
}
```

```js
// my-element.js
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ⋮
  _deleteThing(index) {
    this.things = this.things.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
  }
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

{% aside "warn" %}

Use immutable data patterns to trigger an update.

The `filter()` array method returns a new array which is assigned to
`this.things`. Since the reference stored in `this.things` changes, Lit will
know to update the component when `_deleteThing()` is called. If the array is
mutated instead with something like the `splice()` array method, an update must
be manually requested. See [Mutating objects and array
properties](/docs/components/properties/#mutating-properties) for details.

Now register the handler on the button for each item as the array is being
mapped.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${map(
          this.things,
          (thing, index) => html`
            <li>
              ${thing}
              <button @click=${() => this._deleteThing(index)}>Delete</button>
            </li>
          `
        )}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${map(
          this.things,
          (thing, index) => html`
            <li>
              ${thing}
              <button @click=${() => this._deleteThing(index)}>Delete</button>
            </li>
          `
        )}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now clicking the delete button should remove the item. Note that an inline arrow
function is used here to create closures such that each list item gets a
function that calls `_deleteThing` with its own index.

{% aside "info" %}

While closures will be fine for most cases, there are other ways to achieve this
behavior.

For instance, a property or attribute can be left on the element with the
listener which can then be accessed by the event handler via `event.target`.
When listening to an event that bubbles, using event delegation can be a
convenient way of handling it without attaching event listeners on every item.

templates](/docs/components/events/#listening-to-events-fired-from-repeated-templates).

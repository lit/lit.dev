Lit template literal expressions can contain any JavaScript that returns a
renderable value as described in the [expressions
documentation](/docs/templates/expressions/). When working with arrays, their
prototype methods can be utilized to generate arrays of renderable values as
well.

This example has a component with a `names` property containing an array of
strings.

Use the `filter()` array method to only keep the names that include the letter
"e" followed by a `map()` array method call to generate an array of template
results to place in the component's template.

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
      ${this.names
        .filter((name) => name.match(/e/i))
        .map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
      ${this.names
        .filter((name) => name.match(/e/i))
        .map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

Using array methods is helpful when chaining like this, but does require the
original source to be an array. Consider using the `map()` directive as shown in
the previous step for any iterables that are not arrays.

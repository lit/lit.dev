The tooltip should be initially hidden and displayed only when the user
interacts with the element its hinting. Add the `show` and `hide` methods so
they can be called to manage the display of the tooltip. The best way to
enforce the hidden styling is to use an inline style since this has the
highest precedence in css.

```ts
 show = () => {
    this.style.display = '';
  }

  hide = () => {
    this.style.display = 'none';
  }
```

<aside class="info">
  The <code>show</code> and <code>hide</code> methods are defined using
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" target="_blank">arrow functions</a>.
  This binds the the functions to the element and makes it simpler to use them
  with <code>add/removeEventListener</code> which you'll do next.
</aside>

To ensure the tooltip is initially hidden, call the `hide` method in
`connectedCallback`. This standard custom element lifecycle callback is run when
the element is connected to the DOM.

```ts
connectedCallback() {
  super.connectedCallback();
  this.hide();
}
```

<aside class="info">
 When implementing <code>connectedCallback</code>, it's important to call
  <code>super.connectedCallback()</code> to preserve <code>LitElement</code>'s
  default implementation.

The tooltips should now be hidden.

## Event Listeners

Now that you have gotten rid of the `<template>` element in `index.html`, refactor the code to take advantage of Lit template features in the newly-defined `render()` method. You can start by leveraging Lit's event listener binding syntax:

### rating-element.<ts-js></ts-js>

```html
<button
    class="thumb_down"
    @click=${() => {this.vote = 'down'}}>
...
<button
    class="thumb_up"
    @click=${() => {this.vote = 'up'}}>
```

Lit templates can add an event listener to a node with the `@EVENT_NAME` binding syntax where, in this case, you update the `vote` property every time these buttons are clicked.

{% aside "info" %}

You can learn more about the Lit binding syntax in the [Lit Expressions documentation](/docs/templates/expressions/).

{% endaside %}

Next:

* Clean up the `_boundOn[Up|Down]Click` class members.
* Clean up the event logic in `connectedCallback`.
* Remove `disconnectedCallback`.
* Remove the `_on[Up|Down]Click` methods.

### rating-element.<ts-js></ts-js>

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
export class RatingElement extends HTMLElement {
  private _rating = 0;
  private _vote: 'up'|'down'|null = null;

  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    this.render();
  }

  // remove disonnectedCallback and _onUpClick and _onDownClick
  ...
}
```

```js
export class RatingElement extends HTMLElement {
  _rating = 0;
  _vote = null;

  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    this.render();
  }

  // remove disonnectedCallback and _onUpClick and _onDownClick
  ...
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

You were able to remove:

* The click listener logic from all three callbacks.
* The `disconnectedCallback` entirely.
* All of the DOM initialization code from the `connectedCallback` making it look much more elegant.
* `_onUpClick` and `_onDownClick` listener methods.

## Rendering Property Updates

Finally, update the property setters to utilize the `render` method so that the DOM can update when either the properties or attributes change:

### rating-element.<ts-js></ts-js>

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
set rating(value) {
  this._rating = value;
  // remove the logic for imperatively setting the innerText
  // since it's handled in render()
  this.render();
}

...

set vote(newValue) {
  ...

  this._vote = newValue;
  this.setAttribute('vote', newValue!);
  // call this.render() at the end of the setter
  this.render();
}
```

```js
set rating(value) {
  this._rating = value;
  // remove the logic for imperatively setting the innerText
  // since it's handled in render()
  this.render();
}

...

set vote(newValue) {
  ...

  this._vote = newValue;
  this.setAttribute('vote', newValue);
  // call this.render() at the end of the setter
  this.render();
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

{% aside "warn" %}

This is not the most efficient way to update the DOM.

Synchronously calling `render()` in the setters of `rating` and `vote` is not the most efficient way to update the DOM, but it is a good way to illustrate where `LitElement` calls `render()` (next step).

{% endaside %}

Here, you:

* Removed the DOM update logic from the `rating` setter.
* Added a call to `render` from the `vote` setter.

Now the template is much more readable as you now can see where the bindings and event listeners are applied.

You should have a functioning `<rating-button>` that should look like this when the upvote is pressed!

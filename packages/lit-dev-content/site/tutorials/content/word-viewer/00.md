In this tutorial you will invent your own HTML element: `<word-viewer>`. It's in
the proud tradition of other useful elements like `<marquee>` and `<blink>`! You
can see it on the right!

The `word-viewer` component takes a list of words separated by periods, and
shows them one at a time. You use it in HTML like this:

```html
<word-viewer words="Hello.World"></word-viewer>
```

Clicking it plays the words in reverse, and changes some styles.

# What you'll learn

This is a weird thing to build, but in doing so we'll touch upon all the core
concepts you'll use when building your own Lit components:

* Defining your `<word-viewer></word-viewer>` custom element.
* Setting properties from HTML attributes.
* Rendering to show a single word.
* Lifecycle, and cycling the words.
* Basic styles.
* Basic events.
* Changing styles when play direction changes.

# Previous knowledge

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript, as well
as some basics of Lit covered in the [Intro to Lit
Tutorial](/tutorials/intro-to-lit).

# Why

With this knowledge you can extend HTML to fit your needs! Inventing your own
HTML element means your component will work anywhere HTML works, and since most
frontend frameworks support HTML, your custom elements work
[everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

Lit is also used to develop some awesome open source components. Some of my
favorites:

 * [&lt;Model Viewer>](https://modelviewer.dev/) - Like an `<img>` tag but for
   3D!!!!
 * [Lion component library](https://lion-web.netlify.app/components/) -
   Fundamental white label web components for building  your design system.
 * [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) - A forward-thinking library of web
   components.
 * And many of the [Open Web Components: Component
   Libraries](https://open-wc.org/guides/community/component-libraries/)!

There's nothing to solve in this tutorial part, it's here to show off what
you'll have built by the end.

Add your own `<word-viewer>` tag in the list!

Press "Solve" to see more fun with the `<word-viewer>`, and when you're ready to
build click "Next".

This interactive tutorial will help you get started with Lit and see how simple it is to build fast, lightweight web components.

For a primer on web components, or if you'd like a more traditional tutorial, check out our [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/the-lit-path). You can also review our documentation for more information as you go along.

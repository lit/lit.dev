## Overview

### What are Signals?

Signals are data structures for managing observable state.

A signal can hold either a single value or a computed value that depends on other
signals. Signals are observable, so that a consumer can be notified when they
change. Because they form a dependency graph, computed signals will re-compute and
notify consumers when their dependencies change.

Signals are very useful for modeling and managing **shared observable state**—state
that many different components may access and/or modify. When a signal is updated,
every component that uses and watches that signal, or any signals that depend on
it, will update.

Signals are a general concept, with many different implementations and variations
found in JavaScript libraries and frameworks. There is also now a
[TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) to standardize signals
as part of JavaScript.

Signal APIs typically have three main concepts:

- State signals, which hold a single value
- Computed signals, which wrap a computation that may depend on other signals
- Watchers or effects, which run side-effectful code when signal values change

### Example

Here is an example of signals with the proposed standard JavaScript signals API:

```ts
//
// Code developers might write to build their signals-based state...
//

// State signals hold values:
const count = new Signal.State(0);

// Computed signals wrap computations that use other signals:
const doubleCount = new Signal.Computed(() => count.get() * 2);

//
// Lower-level code of the sort that will typically be inside frameworks and
// signal-consuming libraries...
//

// Watchers are notified when signals that they watch change:
const watcher = new Signal.subtle.Watcher(async () => {
  // Notify callbacks are not allowed to access signals synchronously
  await 0;
  console.log('doubleCount is', doubleCount);
  // Watchers have to be re-enabled after they run:
  watcher.watch();
});
watcher.watch(doubleCount);

// Computed signals are lazy, so we need to read it to run the computation and
// potentially notify watchers:
doubleCount.get();
```

### Signal Libraries

There are many signal implementations built in JavaScript. Many are tightly
integrated into frameworks and only usable from within those frameworks, and
some are standalone libraries that are usable from any other code.

While there are some differences in the specific signals APIs, they are quite
similar.

Preact's signal library,
[`@preact/signals`](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/), is a standalone
library that is relatively fast and small, so we built our first Lit Labs
signals integration package around it:
[`@lit-labs/preact-signals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/preact-signals).

### Signals Proposal for JavaScript

Because of the strong similarities between signal APIs, the increasing use of
signals to implement reactivity in frameworks, and the desire for
interoperability between signal-using systems, a proposal for standardizing
signals is now underway in TC39 at https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals.

Lit provides the
[`@lit-labs/signals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/signals) package
to integrate with the official polyfill for this proposal.

This proposal is very exciting for the web components ecosystem. Because all
libraries and frameworks that adopt the standard will produce compatible signals,
different web components won't have to use the same library to interoperably
consume and produce signals.

What's more, signals have the potential to become the foundation for a wide range
of state management systems and observability libraries, new or existing. Each of
these libraries, like MobX or Redux, currently requires a specific adapter to
ergonomically integrate with the Lit lifecycle. Signals standardization could
mean we eventually need only one Lit adapter (or no adapter at all, when support
for signals is built into the core Lit library).

## Signals and Lit

Lit currently provides two signals integration packages:
[`@lit-labs/signals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/signals) for
integration with the TC39 Signals Proposal, and
[`@lit-labs/preact-signals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/preact-signals)
for integration with Preact Signals.

Because the TC39 Signals Proposal promises to be the one signal API that
JavaScript systems converge on, we recommend using it, and will focus on its
usage in this document.

### Installation

Install `@lit-labs/signals` from npm:

```sh
npm i @lit-labs/signals
```

### Usage

`@lit-labs/signals` provides three main exports:

- The `SignalWatcher` mixin to apply to all classes using signals
- The `watch()` template directive to watch individual signals with pinpoint
  updates
- The `html` template tag to apply the watch directive automatically to template
  bindings

Import these like so:

```ts
import {SignalWatcher, watch, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

`@lit-labs/signals` also exports some of the polyfilled signals API for
convenience, and a `withWatch()` template tag factory so that developers who need
custom template tags can easily add signal-watching functionality.

</div>


#### Auto-watching with SignalWatcher

This simplest way to use signals is to apply the `SignalWatcher` mixin when
defining your Custom Element class. With the mixin applied, you can read
signals in Lit lifecycle methods (like `render()`); any changes to the
values of those signals will automatically initiate an update. You can write
signals wherever it makes sense—for example, in event handlers.

In this example, the `SharedCounterComponent` reads and writes to a shared
signal. Every instance of the component will show the same value, and they will
all update when the value changes.

<!--
  TODO (justinfagnani): Make this an editable sample when the @lit-labs/signals
  package is published.
-->

```ts
import {LitElement, html, css} from 'lit';
import {customElement} from 'lit/decorators.js';
import {SignalWatcher, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';

const count = signal(0);

@customElement('shared-counter')
export class SharedCounterComponent extends SignalWatcher(LitElement) {
  static styles = css`
    :host {
      display: block;
    }
  `;

  render() {
    return html`
      <p>The count is ${count.get()}</p>
      <button @click=${this.#onClick}>Increment</button>
    `;
  }

  #onClick() {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- Both of these elements will show the same counter value -->
<shared-counter></shared-counter>
<shared-counter></shared-counter>
```

#### Pinpoint Updates with `watch()`

Signals can also be used to achieve "pinpoint" DOM updates targeting individual
bindings rather than an entire component. To do this, we need to watch signals
individually with the `watch()` directive.

For coordination purposes, updates triggered by the `watch()` directive are
batched and still participate in the Lit reactive update lifecycle. However,
when a given Lit update has been triggered purely by `watch()` directives, the
only bindings updated are those with changed signals; the rest of the bindings
in the template are skipped.

This example is the same as the previous, but only the `${watch(count)}` binding
is updated when the `count` signal changes:

```ts
import {LitElement, html} from 'lit';
import {customElement} from 'lit/decorators.js';
import {SignalWatcher, watch, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';

const count = signal(0);

@customElement('shared-counter')
export class SharedCounterComponent extends SignalWatcher(LitElement) {
  static styles = css`
    :host {
      display: block;
    }
  `;

  render() {
    return html`
      <p>The count is ${watch(count)}</p>
      <button @click=${this.#onClick}>Increment</button>
    `;
  }

  #onClick() {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  }
}
```

Note that the work avoided by this pinpoint update is actually very little:
the only things skipped are the identity check for the template returned by
`render()` and the value check for the `@click` binding, both of which are cheap.

In fact, in most cases `watch()` will _not_ result in a significant performance
improvement over "plain" Lit template renders. This is because Lit already only
updates the DOM for bindings that have changed values.

The performance savings of `watch()` will tend to scale with the amount of
template logic and the number of bindings that can be skipped in an update, so
savings will be more significant in templates with lots of logic and bindings.

<div class="alert alert-info">

`@lit-labs/signals` does not yet contain a signal-aware `repeat()` directive.
Changes to the contents of arrays will perform full renders until then.

</div>

#### Auto-pinpoint updates with the signals `html` template tag

`@lit-labs/signals` also exports a special version of Lit's `html` template tag
that automatically applies the `watch()` directive to any signal value passed
to a binding.

This can be convenient to avoid the extra characters of the `watch()` directive
or the `signal.get()` calls required without `watch()`.

If you import `html` from `@lit-labs/signals` instead of from `lit`, you will
get the auto-watching feature:

```ts
import {LitElement} from 'lit';
import {SignalWatcher, html, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';

// SharedCounterComponent ...
  render() {
    return html`
      <p>The count is ${count}</p>
      <button @click=${this.#onClick}>Increment</button>
    `;
  }
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">

The signals `html` tag doesn't yet work well with lit-analyzer. The analyzer
will report type errors on bindings that use signals becuase it sees an
assigment of `Signal<T>` to `T`.

</div>

## Ensuring proper polyfill installation

`@lit-labs/signals` includes the `signal-polyfill` package as a dependency, so
you don't need to explicitly install anything else to start using signals.

But since signals rely on a shared global data structure (the signal dependency
graph), it's critically important that the polyfill is installed properly:
there can be only one copy of the polyfill package in any page or app.

If more than one copy of the polyfill is installed (either because of
incompatible versions or other npm mishaps) then it's possible to _partition_
the signal graph so that some watchers will not work with some signals, or some
signals will not be tracked as dependencies of others.

To prevent this, be sure to check that there's only one installation of
`signal-polyfill`, using the `npm ls` command:

```sh
npm ls signal-polyfill
```

If you see more than one listing for `signal-polyfill` _without_ `deduped` next
to the line, then you have duplicate copies of the polyfill.

You can usually fix this by running:

```sh
npm dedupe
```

If that doesn't work, you may have to update dependencies until you get a single
compatible version of `signal-polyfill` across your package installation.

## Missing Features

`@lit-labs/signals` is not feature-complete. There are a few envisioned features
that will make working with signals in Lit more viable and performant:

- [ ] A signal-aware `repeat()` directive. This will make incremental updates to
      arrays more efficient.
- [ ] A `@property()` decorator that uses signals for storage, to unify reactive
      properties and signals. This will make it easier to use generic signal
      utilities with Lit reactive properties.
- [ ] A `@computed()` decorator for marking methods as computed signals. Since
      computed signals are memoized, this can help with expensive computations.
- [ ] An `@effect()` decorator for marking methods as effects. This can be a
      more ergonomic way of running effects than using a separate utility.

## Useful Resources

### `signal-utils`

The `signal-utils` npm package contains a number of utilities for working with
the TC39 Signals Proposal, including:

- Signal-backed, observable, collections like `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`,
  `WeakSet`, and `Object`
- Decorators for building classes with signal-backed fields
- Effects and reactions

These collections and decorators are useful for building observable data models
from signals, where you will often need to manage values more complicated than a
primitive.

#### Collections

For instance, you can make an observable array:

```ts
import {SignalArray} from 'signal-utils/array';

const numbers = new SignalArray([1, 2, 3]);
```

Reading from the array, like iterating over it or reading `.length` will be
tracked as signal access, and mutations of the array, like from `.push()` or
`.pop()`, will notify any watchers.

#### Decorators

The decorators let you model a class with observable fields, much like a
`LitElement`:

```ts
import {signal} from 'signal-utils';

class GameState {
  @signal
  accessor playerOneTotal = 0;

  @signal
  accessor playerTwoTotal = 0;

  @signal
  accessor over = false;

  readonly rounds = new SignalArray();

  recordRound(playerOneScore, playerTwoScore) {
    this.playerOneTotal += playerOneScore;
    this.playerTwoTotal += playerTwoScore;
    this.rounds.push([playerOneScore, playerTwoScore]);
  }
}
```

Instances of this `GameState` class will be tracked by SignalWatcher classes
that access it, and will update when the game state changes.

## Status and Feedback

This package is part of the Lit Labs family of experimental packages and under
active development. There may be missing features, serious bugs in the
implementation, and more frequent breaking changes than with the core Lit
libraries.

This package also relies on a proposal and polyfill that themselves are not
stable. As the signals proproposal progresses, breaking changes may be made to
the proposed API, which will then be made to the polyfill.

We encourage cautious use in order for us to gain experience with and get
feedback on the Lit integration layer, but please manage dependencies carefully
and test judiciously so that unexpected breaking changes are kept to a minimum.

Please leave feedback on the [@lit-labs/signals feedback
discussion](https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions/4779), and [file any
issues](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues) you encounter.

Feedback on the Signals proposal can be left on the [Signals proposal
repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals). Issues with the polyfill
can be filed [here](https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-polyfill).

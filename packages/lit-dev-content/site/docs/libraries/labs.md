The Lit team has a number of  <strong>Labs</strong> projects that can be used with Lit. These projects are in active development and may not be ready for production release: for example, they may be missing features, or subject to breaking changes. Labs projects are published under the `@lit-labs` npm scope.

Current Labs projects include:

* [Motion](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/motion/README.md#lit-labsmotion). Animation helpers for Lit templates. The `@lit-labs/motion` package includes an `animate` directive for adding tweening animations when an element changes state, as well as an `AnimateController` class for programmatically controlling and coordinating animations. You can find a number of motion examples in the [Playground](https://lit.dev/playground/#sample=examples/motion-simple).
* [React](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/react#lit-labsreact). React integration helpers for custom elements and reactive controllers.
* [scoped-registry-mixin](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/scoped-registry-mixin#lit-labsscoped-registry-mixin) Mixin for Lit that integrates with the speculative [Scoped CustomElementRegistry polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/scoped-custom-element-registry).
* [SSR](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr#lit-labsssr). A package for server-side rendering Lit templates and components.
* [Task](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/task/README.md#lit-labstask). A reactive controller for handling asynchronous tasks.
